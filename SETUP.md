## Quick Start

### 1. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open: http://localhost:5173

### 2. Add Sign Language Videos (Optional)

When you have sign language videos, put them in:
```
public/assets/videos/sign-language/[theme-name]/[word].mp4
public/assets/videos/sign-language/[theme-name]/[word].gif
```

The paths are already configured in themes.js!

### 3. Regenerate themes.js (If you add more images)

```bash
node generate-themes.js
```

This will automatically:
- Scan all theme folders
- Find all images
- Update themes.js with new items

## What's Missing (Optional Additions)

### Sign Language Videos

Just add the files and they'll work automatically!

The body-parts folder exists but has no images yet. Add some images and run:
```bash
node generate-themes.js
```

## Customization

### Change Theme Colors
Edit `generate-themes.js` → `themeConfigs` section:
```javascript
'animals': {
  name: 'Animals',
  backgroundColor: '#98FB98',  // Change this color
  icon: 'pi pi-heart'
}
```

Then run: `node generate-themes.js`

### Add New Theme
1. Create folder: `public/assets/images/themes/new-theme/`
2. Add images to the folder
3. Run: `node generate-themes.js`
4. The theme appears automatically!

### Modify Game Settings
Edit `src/data/games.js` to change:
